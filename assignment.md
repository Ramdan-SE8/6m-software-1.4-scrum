## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Firstly, the concept of SCRUM brings about better efficiency in tackling the project due to its departure from traditional waterfall type of project management. Traditionally, when a project is handled from start to completion using the waterfall concept, the project moves forward in 5 to 6 key phases in a sequential manner from start to end. Typically it begins with the 'Requirements' phase where the objectives of the project are identified. This is followed by the 'Design' stage where the application design and features are conceptualised to meet the requirements of the application. After which product development begins. This is then followed by 'Testing', 'Deployment' and 'Maintenance' phases. The entire process from start to end typically last as long as 6 months.
In comparison - the SCRUM concept breaks up the entire cycle into small cycles of 'sprints' lasting for a relatively short duration of 1 to 2 weeks in which the team achieves incremental product completion for each sprint cycle. An advantage derived from working in sprints is that the team is able to prioritise which are the more important or critical features that ought to be tackled first in the early stage sprints whereas less important features are saved for the end stage sprints. This gives the added benefit that should the team encounter significant obstacles which warrants a major design change, the team is able to react and adapt quickly, one sprint at a time, and this can help to identify project risks earlier at the beginning and help to minimise abortive work.
Secondly, the processes of SCRUM are highly systematic and well defined. For example, the work to be tackled are defined and categorised as Product Backlog items, with individual items being the specific features that are required of the end product or application. And for every feature, corresponding user stories are defined. More critical and important Product Backlog items can be prioritised and form sprint backlog items early in the project. Less important and nice to have backlog items are deferred to later sprints.
The SCRUM process also defines specific human roles that keep the process running smoothly and effectively, such as the Product Owner, SCRUM Master and the Development Team. The process also sets out specific processes such as sprint planning, daily standups, sprint review and sprint retrospective. Such a structured and systematic method of working makes it a very convenient framework which can be easily adopted by the team and overall it brings better work efficiency and productivity compared to waterfall style of management.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1) As a member of public, I want to view libary location maps and operating hours, so that I know where to locate nearest library and when to visit the library.
2)As a member of public, I want to be able to enrol membership online, so that I don't need to spend additional time travelling to and waiting at the library in person.
3)As a member of public, I want to be able to be able to view job vacancy information, so that I can apply for jobs at the library.
4)As a library member, I want to view available library facilities online (eg meeting rooms, study rooms, etc), so that I can apply to use or reserve such facilities when I need to use them.
5)As a library member, I want to view and search book catalogue information online, so that I can borrow the books that I need.
6)As a library member, I want to view my book loan details, so that I can check for outstanding book loans.
7)As a library member, I want to be able to update personal particulars online, so that details like address and contact information can be updated conveniently.
8)As a website administrator, I want to have privileged admin login, so that I can administer changes to website content.
9)As a library CS officer, I want to view book loans records, so that I can assist members with book loan enquiries.
10)As a library CS officer, I want to be able to create new membership signups online, so that I can assist members of public with new signup requests.
